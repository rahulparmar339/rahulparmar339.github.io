<h2>What is Infectious Disease?</h2><br>
</p>

			 <p class="lead">

Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms.like microorganism, viruses,
fungi or parasites. several organisms  are in our bodies.
 they are usually harmless or may be useful, however  some organisms could cause harm to our body.
Malaria, Tuberculosis.plague etc. are some of the example of Infectious dieses.


</p>



<p class="lead">
<h2>Symptoms</h2><br>
</p>
<p class="lead">
 Each communicable disease has its own specific signs and symptoms. General signs and symptoms common to variety of infectious diseases include:
 <ul class="lead">
 <li >Fever</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Muscle aches</li>
<li>Coughing</li>

 </ul>

<p class="lead">

Viruses: viruses are Even smaller than microorganism, viruses cause a mess of diseases  starting from the communicable disease to AIDS.

</p>

<p class="lead">
Fungi: several skin diseases, like tinea and tinea pedis, are caused by fungi.
alternative sorts of fungi will infect our  lungs and  nervous system.</p>


<p class="lead">
Parasites : protozoal infection is caused by a small parasite that’s transmitted by a insect bite.
 alternative parasites could also be transmitted to humans from animal
</p>
<p class = "lead">
	
Direct contact : Infectious dieseses can also caused by direct contact.
There are 3 ways of direct contacts can cause infectious diseases.<br>
1)Person to person : this is done by physical contact with person who is affected.<br> 
2)Animal to person : If one animal bite the person then its virus can come to person’s body and can cause dieses.<br> 
3)Pregnant Mother to baby: A pregnant lady could pass germs that cause infectious diseases to her  baby.
</p>
	
<p class = "lead">
Indirect contact : Disease-causing organisms can also be glided by indirect contact.If one person who is affected by infectious dieseas touch the handle of door and after that a healthy person touches the handle are example of Indirect contact 
</p>

<p class = "lead">	
Insect bites : Some germs are carried by insects like mosquitos and flys.If they bite the human or sit on the food it can cause the dieses.
Most infectious diseases have solely minor complications. however some infections like respiratory disorder, AIDS  will become grievous. 
Some sorts of infections are joined to a long-run augmented risk of  cancer.

<h2>What is hepatitis?</h2><br>
</p>

			 <p class="lead">
			 
			  

 
			There are ~2 billion people who have been infected by HBV worldwide.
			Hepatitis is viral infection observed in liver.They are different type of hepatitis <br>

1)Hepatitis A<br>

2)Hepatitis B<br>
3)Hepatitis C<br>
4)Hepatitis D<br>
5)Hepatitis E<br>

but most common are Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B ,Hepatitis C


</p>



<p class="lead">
<h2>Hepatitis B(HBV)</h2><br>
</p>
<p class="lead">
Hepatitis b is a form of viral Hepatitis. 

It is seen in both adult and infants. 

The virus infects the hepatocytes.



A simple blood test can show whether you have Hepatitis B or not.

the blood sample is collected from your liver and is taken using a sterilized needle.

Presence of Hepatitis B vaccination in your body can also found out from this blood test.

In major cases Hepatitis B goes away on its own. 

A healthy diet,adequate rest, drinking plenty of water and following doctors prescription can releive you from the infection.
</p>

 
 <p class="lead">
 <h2>Chronic Hepatitis B</h2> 
</p>
<p class="lead">
The advanced stage of Hepatitis B is Chronic Hepatitis B. 
It is majorly seen in children and young people who are affected with Hepatitis B.
People affected by Chronic Hepatitis B have no symptoms.

 
Treatment for chronic Hepatitis B depends on the level of affection in your lever and if it is increasing or stable.
 There are many treatments available for curing chronic hepatitis B but they have lots of side effects. 
CRISPR/cas9 is one of the best available treatments right now and
many discoveries have come into light in the recent years.

                <p class="lead">


 When the virus infects the human body the outer shell breaks away
and all that is left is the caspid and the virus inside it (1), caspid is the
protein shell of the virus. The caspid along with the virus migrates to the
liver cells and delivers the genomic rcDNA (2), relaxed circular DNA. Which
is then converted into the cccDNA-covalently closed circular DNA (3), it is a
special structured DNA that is formed during the migration of the virus cells
into the nucleus of the host cells. This cccDNA attacks the genome of the
host cells and fuses itself into the host DNA.

<h2>what is CRISPR?</h2><br>
</p>

			 <p class="lead">
			 
			  

 
			CRISPR is one kind of defence mechanism in some of bacteria, it was first observed in 1980. It's part of immune system of bacteria. One DNA sequence would
be repeated over and over again, and this DNA sequence was carrying an
unique sequences in between those repeated sequence. This odd
configuration is called “Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,”
or CRISPR. There is also one enzyme called cas(CRISPR-associated protein) which is also part of CRISPR system.



</p>



<p class="lead">
<h2>How does CRISPR/cas9 works to protect against viral infection in bacteria?</h2><br>
</p>
<p class="lead">
Whenever infectious virus attack bacteria it joins in between DNA of bacteria.
In bacteria CRISPR/cas9 will be automatically produced. CRISPR is actually guide RNA(gRNA) which will guide what defence mechanism to viral DNA sequence. And then gRNA will join with viral DNA sequence (gRNA is actually complementary sequence of viral DNA), cas9 enzyme with bind with joined part and it will cut viral sequence from bacteria DNA using molecular scissors. And then bacteria will add some mutation to that gap. This way CRISPR/cas9 helps to remove viral sequence.
</p>


<p class="lead">
<h2>8kb Vector pCas-Guide Example</h2>

            <div class="col-lg-8">
                <p class="lead">

As you  can see in Figure it's 8kb vector pCas-Guide (CRISPR/cas9) works same way as CRISPR/cas9 defence mechanism works in bacteria. It is also available in market. It can remove desired viral DNA sequence from human body. pCas-Guide is called Vector

        </div>
    </div>
 
  
<p class="lead">
AMP is kind of marker which is used to detection of Vector when we deploy vector into human body (works like GPS tracker for vector).
gRNA is guide RNA which complementary sequence of viral DNA(that we want to remove). Target is sequence is DNA sequence that will  replace viral DNA sequence .Cas9 is enzyme to cut viral DNA sequence using molecular scissors. When vector gets deploy in human body, gRNA will guide this vector to viral DNA sequence and gRNA will join with viral DNA sequence. Cas9 will bind this joined part and cut viral DNA sequence and will place target DNA sequence in place of viral DNA sequence. This way it's works to remove viral DNA sequence in human body.

NUCs restrain the combination of viral DNA from RNA by using P protein. NUCs can adequately decrease viral DNA level by numerous logs; be that as it may, infection reactivation regularly happens inside weeks to months after treatment withdrawal. In outcome, deep rooted of NUC treatment is generally required. Moreover, long haul NUC treatment may prompt the determination of ill transformations

<p class="lead">The given picture demonstrates the schematic portrayal of the HBV genome.The open ring outlines Core(C), Polymerase(P), Surface(S) and X proteins are the viral transcripts. The specked line speak to the cccDNA of the genome and the thin line speaks to the rcDNA of the genome. As should be obvious in the picture a few sections of ORF S and ORF X focalize the cccDNA and these are the protection locales where ORF implies open ring outline. These preservation arrangements shape the single guide RNA and the PAM themes were recognized in this succession itself.
</p>
<p class="lead">
A similar relationship was utilized and the preservationist arrangements for different variations were additionally distinguished. The single guide RNA groupings are utilized for directing the nucleases to the influenced zones of the DNA and cut them out. Then the cas9 finishes the slice the cells attempt to repair the DNA.
