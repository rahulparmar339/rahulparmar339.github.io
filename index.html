Hepatitis b is a form of viral Hepatitis. 

It is seen in both adult and infants. 

The virus infects the hepatocytes.



A simple blood test can show whether you have Hepatitis B or not.

the blood sample is collected from your liver and is taken using a sterilized needle.

Presence of Hepatitis B vaccination in your body can also found out from this blood test.

In major cases Hepatitis B goes away on its own. 

A healthy diet,adequate rest, drinking plenty of water and following doctors prescription can releive you from the infection.

 <p class="lead">
 <h2>Chronic Hepatitis B</h2> 
</p>
<p class="lead">
The advanced stage of Hepatitis B is Chronic Hepatitis B. 
It is majorly seen in children and young people who are affected with Hepatitis B.
People affected by Chronic Hepatitis B have no symptoms.

 
Treatment for chronic Hepatitis B depends on the level of affection in your lever and if it is increasing or stable.
 There are many treatments available for curing chronic hepatitis B but they have lots of side effects. 
CRISPR/cas9 is one of the best available treatments right now and
many discoveries have come into light in the recent years.

<h2>what is CRISPR?</h2><br>
</p>

			 <p class="lead">
			 
			  

 
			CRISPR is one kind of defence mechanism in some of bacteria, it was first observed in 1980. It's part of immune system of bacteria. One DNA sequence would
be repeated over and over again, and this DNA sequence was carrying an
unique sequences in between those repeated sequence. This odd
configuration is called “Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,”
or CRISPR. There is also one enzyme called cas(CRISPR-associated protein) which is also part of CRISPR system.



</p>



<p class="lead">
<h2>How does CRISPR/cas9 works to protect against viral infection in bacteria?</h2><br>
</p>
<p class="lead">
Whenever infectious virus attack bacteria it joins in between DNA of bacteria.
In bacteria CRISPR/cas9 will be automatically produced. CRISPR is actually guide RNA(gRNA) which will guide what defence mechanism to viral DNA sequence. And then gRNA will join with viral DNA sequence (gRNA is actually complementary sequence of viral DNA), cas9 enzyme with bind with joined part and it will cut viral sequence from bacteria DNA using molecular scissors. And then bacteria will add some mutation to that gap. This way CRISPR/cas9 helps to remove viral sequence.
</p>


<p class="lead">
<h2>8kb Vector pCas-Guide Example</h2> 
</p>
<div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
             
            <div class="col-lg-8">
                <p class="lead">

As you  can see in Figure it's 8kb vector pCas-Guide (CRISPR/cas9) works same way as CRISPR/cas9 defence mechanism works in bacteria. It is also available in market. It can remove desired viral DNA sequence from human body. pCas-Guide is called Vector

            </div>

             
        </div>
    </div>
 
  
<p class="lead">
AMP is kind of marker which is used to detection of Vector when we deploy vector into human body (works like GPS tracker for vector).
gRNA is guide RNA which complementary sequence of viral DNA(that we want to remove). Target is sequence is DNA sequence that will  replace viral DNA sequence .Cas9 is enzyme to cut viral DNA sequence using molecular scissors. When vector gets deploy in human body, gRNA will guide this vector to viral DNA sequence and gRNA will join with viral DNA sequence. Cas9 will bind this joined part and cut viral DNA sequence and will place target DNA sequence in place of viral DNA sequence. This way it's works to remove viral DNA sequence in human body.

liver cells and delivers the genomic rcDNA (2), relaxed circular DNA. Which
is then converted into the cccDNA-covalently closed circular DNA (3), it is a
special structured DNA that is formed during the migration of the virus cells
into the nucleus of the host cells. This cccDNA attacks the genome of the
host cells and fuses itself into the host DNA.
